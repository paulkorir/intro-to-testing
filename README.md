# intro-to-testing

This is a simple example on how to include unit tests to set of Python scripts. Unit tests in Python are provided through the [`unittest` package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). You can skip straight to the list of [all assertion methods available](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods).

Feel free to fork this project to use it a base for your new projects.
